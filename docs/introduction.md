## What is Document AI?
Document AI became generally available in August 2025.
Use Document AI to extract data from unstructured documents like scanned reports or PDFs.
As of today, you can access Document AI on your own Developer's Edition org.
It takes time to manually type in the candidate's name, age, work experience, and certificates from a resume. However, using Document AI, you can automate data extraction from a file. 
All you need to do is to set up the configuration so that Document AI knows what kinds of fields to look for. 


## Use Cases
1. Invoice & Receipt Processing (Finance / AP Automation)
2. Contract Data Extraction
3. HR & Employee Document Processing

## License 
Document AI is available with Data 360 licenses only. It is not available with Customer Data Platform licenses.
